					<h1>Who is Emmet Journeaux Minihan?</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Born in 1990, a duel national with a culturally diverse and artistic background, raised in both Ireland and New Zealand.</p>
					<p>With a solid background in hospitality management and sales, I am passionate about solving problems, bringing ideas into life, and helping people interact with the world around them. </p1>
					
					<p>Over the past two decades, I have lived worked and studied in a verity of different locations and cities from Cork Ireland to Sydney Australia. I finished my high school education in West Cork, Ireland in 2008 where I embarked on a creative path exploring audio production through initially S.I.T Invercargill, New Zealand and then SAE London, England. Unfortunately, the financing of my studies became an issue and as a result my interests changed and led me to obtaining a distinction in QQI level 5 Business Administration from Cork Collage of commerce, Ireland.</p2>
					<p>I am dedicated to the devotions of learning how to understand the technologies that are shaping the world at which I am a part of.</p1>

					<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My interest in information technology stems from two elements, firstly my comfort level with using technology and secondly my discomfort with a lack of deep understanding and implementation of this technology regarding future job security. </p>
					<p>Growing up in the nineties I am old enough to remember the dial up internet connection and to have witnessed the emergence of electronic commerce. I am fascinated by the simplicity that technology can bring to our lives, throughout my time studying audio production and working in hospitality management the reliance on information technology has grown exponentially. I have the deep passion for problem solving and bringing creative ideas into life, as the world rapidly becomes more digital, it has instilled a strong desire for me to make the move from being a user to a developer.</p>

					<h1>Why I chose to start my path with RMIT? </h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>The reason I am choosing RMIT to start my learning journey is because I am attracted to the diversity of the student body; RMIT has a healthy percentage of diverse ethnic groups and a higher percentage of international students than other schools I have looked at. With 78% of the alumni stating that RMIT had a positive impact on their careers. I want to be exposed to a wide variety of subjects taught by industry and academic professionals in the field of IT.  I like that RMIT has a globally recognized status for tremendous research facilities with industry connections, and flexibility to learn remotely. </P>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionTitle">
					<h1>What do I expect to take from my studies? </h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>While undertaking this study with RMIT, I look to develop the essential skills required for effective learning, communication, and research to obtain a knowledge of current and potential IT systems, technologies, and technology infrastructures. Ultimately, I am looking to use my time at RMIT to build the soft and hard skills required to streamline myself as a methodical and an analytical individual capable of working independently or as part of a team to gain job security within the industry.</p>

					<h2>Web Developer</h2>
					<h3>Art Gallery of NSW</h3>
					<p>The aesthetic, the environment, the culture.</p>
					<h3>the position</h3>
					<p>As someone who visits an art gallery three times a week, it shocks me how far removed the digital products are from the environment at which they truly represent. This role of a web developer at the Art Gallery of NSW fits both my desire to work in and around a team of creatives and work on front-end user’s experience regarding digital products and services. </p>
					<h3>the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h3>
					<li>Relevant tertiary qualifications </li>
					<li>Proof of ability to implement high-level web development technologies to create a comfortable experience for end users.</li>
					<li>Experience and ability to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
					<li>Knowledge of other required systems to create integration.</li>
					<li>Communication and time management skills to work on project deadlines and liaising with other parties included in the project.</li>
					<li>Requires strong understanding of component-based architecture, management systems, databases. </li>
					<p></p>
					<h3>the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have </h3>
					<p>At present I am coming in at ground zero and starting to embark on learning some of the basic skills that are needed to do this job such as OO technologies in the form of (java and phyton) some basic web development technologies (HTML, CSS, PHP). I have not yet worked on a real IT projects neither do I have any technology qualifications yet. However, I can still bring something into this project as mentioned I do have a great understanding of what the end users (gallery visitors) would expect to see as a regular visitor of art galleries and the son a distinguished visual artist. Combining with my future qualifications and experiences, I believe I can do a great job in such position. </p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>To fulfill my desire to work as a web developer, I have enrolled to study IT at RMIT where I hope to learn some of the basic skills required to work towards building an understanding to enter the IT sector. As roles of this nature require experience with specific technologies as well as tertiary qualifications, I will be looking to gain experience through internships and external projects throughout my studies. I would need to have a post-graduate experience in a firm/on projects where I can build confidence to excel to do the job that is advertised.  To achieve this, I am planning to start an internship as soon as possible.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
				<p>ParKd </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>ParKd, A motorcycle app for Sydney.  </P>
					<p>A free, community-based user rated two wheeled parking location app. Providing a platform for locating the closest community rated parking near your chosen location.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>Personally, as a two wheeled commuter living in Sydney this app is needed. </p>
					<p>Parking is in high demand in Sydney between residents, workers and soon to be visitors who ride. Finding a safe place to park is not always possible and it is a timely expense that could and should be mitigated.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
				
				<p>ParKd is an application for people who ride everyday within the city as well as those who are visiting for different purposes or just moving into the city. </p>
				<p>Personally, I have been struggling to find a park place ever since I have moved to Sydney. Looking for a place where I can park securely on two wheels might not also be safe for the others in traffic as well. Another issue is that my bike has been hit and broken in one of those areas. Hence why I would like to know how safe and secure these places are as an outsider. Having this app would make life much easier for me and other two-wheel commuters.</p>
				<p>Building a mobile application with use of geoprocessing, routing, and mapping. </p>
				<p>It is essential that ParKd has a user-friendly interface, in a little three clicks you have your space.</p>
				<li>When the user opens the app, they are presented with approximate location and a search box to enter their desired parking location.</li>
				<li>The user is then presented with the alternative parking locations with user safety ratings.</li>
				<li>The user will be asked to pick out of five stars how happy they were to leave their vehicle to provide insight for the other users.</li>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>the following technologies will be needed </p>
					<li>HTML </li>

				</article>

					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
				<p>Strong understanding of GIS technologies specifically ArcGIS Runtime API for Java. </p>
